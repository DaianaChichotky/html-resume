      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I hold a degree in Food Science and Technology and have over 10 years of experience
        in the manufacturing industry. Along the way, I discovered a strong passion for data
        analytics and decided to take it further â€” graduating in Data Analytics in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, Iâ€™m expanding my skills into software development, currently focusing on becoming a
        Full Stack Developer. Iâ€™m learning technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
        Python, and SQL, as well as design tools like Figma. Iâ€™m passionate about building
        meaningful projects that combine creativity, logic, and data-driven insights.
